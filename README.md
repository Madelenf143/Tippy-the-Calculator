## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Learning the syntax of the Mac computer and operating system was a challenge in itself. I am more accustomed to using windows and have never used a mac laptop before, but was drawn to learning how to develope apps for iOS since this would give me some sort of insight as to how to apps for my phone can be created. Also, being fairly new to code, I made numerous syntax mistakes (mispelling variables, forgetting to include end brackets) and it would take me a while to understand what the error messages where saying in the code editor. I also had to go through multiple iterations of this project. The first time I tired out the project, I made a mistake which resulted in red error messages along every other line that I was not able to fix so I restarted.  Nonetheless, the experience was rewarding as I got a glimpse into both the design aspect of mobile applications and figuring out the logic behind it. Being able to do this work is a powerful skillset: visualize an interface and effectively execute it. I know I was not able to implement the extra features, and it's not reflective of my interest or commitment to this project but I do plan on creating an updated version (within this week) that works smoother adn allows me to explore the other features available.
